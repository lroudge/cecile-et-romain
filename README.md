## Motivation and purpose :grey_question:

This project is an informational website for my friends Cécile & Romain's wedding happening in August 2021. They needed a website, I wanted a front-end side-project, so we agreed I'd do it for them!

## Choice of technologies :hammer:

I had freedom to code this website however I wanted, but we had a few desires:

* I wanted it to be hosted on a free hosting platform.
* My friends wanted it to be international and have at least french and english translations.
* I wanted to implement Continuous Delivery so that I could share my progress with my friends and get their feedback as I went.
* I wanted to use React in order to showcase what I have learned since I started working.

Because of all those reasons, I decided to use the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework. Its features would allow me to:

* Use a variation of i18next package (next-i18next) for internationalization,
* Develop a quick functional React app with minimum configuration and dynamic routing,
* Use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=next-website) and its seamless integration with Next.js for deployment,
* Use Typescript,
* Have fun because it's a framework I like!

## Usage in dev mode :computer:

I don't think anyone is going to want to run this website, but in case, check the documentation in the [src](./src/README.md) directory.
